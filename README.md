## Fruit Market jQuery challenge
Created 4 commodities:
1. Apples
2. Oranges
3. Bananas
4. Grapes

Includes following changing variables:
* Market price
* Available cash
* Fruit Average Price

### Instructions:
For this challenge, you will be working with 4 commodities; Apples, Oranges, Bananas, and Grapes. Delicious, right?

When the application loads, you will need to have information for each of the commodities, specifically the name and the market price of each. This information will need to be displayed in a meaningful way on the DOM.

Every 15 seconds, the prices should change, and with it, the listed price on the DOM. Specifically, the market price of each of the items should fluctuate up or down 50 cents (between 1 cent and 50 cents) with each 15 second interval. Any given fruit is not allowed to go below a cost of 50 cents, or above the cost of 9 dollars and 99 cents.

The information displayed for each of the fruit should have a button-like functionality where the user can interact with each of the fruit displays.

Available to the user is a total cash and an inventory display that shows how much of each of the fruits they have purchased. Also in the user display, should be an average purchased price, which shows, on average, how much money they have spent on a given fruit in their inventory.

Clicking on the display for each of the fruits allows the user to buy one of the fruits, at market price, which will be deducted from the total cash. The user is not allowed to spend more than they have.

The user will start with $100.
